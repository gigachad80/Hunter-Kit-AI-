
The script is executed from the command line and has the following usage options:


Usage : openredirex [-p payloads] [-k keyword] [-c concurrency]
                    -p, --payloads: File containing a list of payloads. If not specified, a hardcoded list is used.
                    -k, --keyword: Keyword in URLs to replace with payload. Default is "FUZZ".
                    -c, --concurrency: Number of concurrent tasks. Default is 100.

The script expects a list of URLs as input. Each URL should contain the keyword specified by the -k option. The script replaces the keyword with each of the payloads, and attempts to fetch the modified URL.

Example usage:

cat list_of_urls.txt |  openredirex -p payloads.txt -k "FUZZ" -c 50
List of URLs should look like below:

cat list_of_urls.txt

https://newsroom.example.com/logout?redirect=FUZZ
https://auth.example.com/auth/realms/sonatype/protocol/openid-connect/logout?redirect_uri=test
https://exmaple.com/php?test=baz&foo=bar


This example reads URLs from the file list_of_urls.txt, replaces all the values of the parameters to FUZZ (if --keyword is not supplied), then again replaces the keyword FUZZ or the supplied keyword with each payload from payloads.txt, and fetches each URL concurrently, with a maximum of 50 concurrent tasks.
