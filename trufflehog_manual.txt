      --archive-max-depth=ARCHIVE-MAX-DEPTH
                                 Maximum depth of archive to scan.
      --archive-timeout=ARCHIVE-TIMEOUT
                                 Maximum time to spend extracting an archive.
      --include-detectors="all"  Comma separated list of detector types to include. Protobuf name or IDs may be used, as well as ranges.
      --exclude-detectors=EXCLUDE-DETECTORS
                                 Comma separated list of detector types to exclude. Protobuf name or IDs may be used, as well as ranges. IDs defined here take precedence over the include list.
      --version             Show application version.
  -i, --include-paths=INCLUDE-PATHS
                                 Path to file with newline separated regexes for files to include in scan.
  -x, --exclude-paths=EXCLUDE-PATHS
                                 Path to file with newline separated regexes for files to exclude in scan.
      --exclude-globs=EXCLUDE-GLOBS
                                 Comma separated list of globs to exclude in scan. This option filters at the `git log` level, resulting in faster scans.

                                 Commit to start scan from.
      --branch=BRANCH            Branch to scan.
