#### grep-backURLs : 

### 📌 Overview


 *_grep-backURLs_* is a web security automation tool to extracts important credentials in bug hunting. It uses subfinder to find subdomains and then those subdomain acts as input links for waybackurls . After that , it uses grep command and keywords.txt to sort out important credentials.

### 🤔 Why This Name?

All the tools I have selected are commonly used by web app pentesters, so you can consider it a toolkit for bug hunters. Since it uses AI for command generation and answering questions, I named it 'Hunter Kit AI' .
